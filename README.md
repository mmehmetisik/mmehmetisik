## About Me

I am Mehmet, a highly motivated individual who is interested in the field of data science. I constantly seek opportunities to learn and grow, and I have a strong background in teamwork and collaboration. Stepping outside of my comfort zone is not a challenge for me, as I have repeatedly demonstrated my ability to do so. It is not about changing a place or environment, but rather a mindset of pushing my limits to do things better. I am excited to take on new challenges, bring my skills and experience to your team, and contribute to the success of the company.
